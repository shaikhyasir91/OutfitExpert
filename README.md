## Introduction
OutfitExpert is a deep learning-based project aimed at recognizing fashion items and planning outfits. This system uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to accurately classify various clothing items and generate stylish outfit recommendations. The user interface, built with PyQt5, provides an intuitive platform for users to interact with the application, upload images, and receive fashion advice.

## Features
Recognizes and classifies fashion items from images.
Generates outfit recommendations based on user inputs.
User-friendly GUI developed with PyQt5.
High accuracy in classification of fashion items.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle:
[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small)

## Tools and Technologies
PyQt5: For developing the GUI, allowing users to interact with the system, upload images, and receive recommendations.
Google Colab: Used for training the deep learning models, providing access to GPU resources for faster computation.
Scikit-learn: Used for data preprocessing tasks such as label encoding and splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Transfer Learning: Utilized pre-trained models to enhance the performance and accuracy of the fashion item classification.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Employed for the image classification tasks, forming the core of the recognition system.

## Usage
Run this [notebook](https://github.com/shaikhyasir91/OutfitExpert/blob/main/1)) to train the model (if not using a pre-trained model):

run this python [script](https://github.com/shaikhyasir91/OutfitExpert/blob/main/1)) to run GUI.
Use the GUI to upload images and generate outfit recommendations.
